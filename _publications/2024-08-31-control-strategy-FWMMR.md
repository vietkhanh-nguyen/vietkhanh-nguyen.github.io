This paper introduces a path-planning and trajectory-tracking strategy for liquid transfer using a four- wheel mecanum mobile robot platform. A rest-to-rest trajectory is designed based on the flatness properties of the sloshing phenomenon in a moving container to ensure the stability of the liquid at the destination. Then a hierarchical sliding mode controller is utilized to achieve tracking performance. Using Lyapunov synthesis, the overall system is guaranteed its robustness and stability even under external disturbance. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy, simulations are carried out in Matlab/SIMULINK environment.
