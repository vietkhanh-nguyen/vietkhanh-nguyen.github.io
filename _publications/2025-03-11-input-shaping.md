In the field of liquid sloshing control, the input shaping method is widely used due to its ability to effectively control oscillations by providing specific motion commands that cancel out oscillations without the need for feedback signals. This paper proposes a combined control structure that integrates two methods: Input shaping and Lyapunov-based model predictive control (LMPC), which allows setting limits for state variables in the system. The controller is developed based on a discrete nonlinear mechanical model of the mass-spring-damper, which is commonly used to simulate liquid dynamics. Simulation findings illustrate the efficacy of the suggested control system by demonstrating the control signals as the liquid container moves from the trajectory's starting point to its endpoint. This method also presents effectiveness in tracking the container's movement trajectory and significantly reduces the phenomenon of liquid oscillation during system operation or due to the effects of external disturbances through the use of feedback control.
