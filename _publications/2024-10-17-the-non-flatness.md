Sloshing, the back-and-forth motion of liquids in containers, can significantly impact various systems and structures. This study proposes a control system to minimize the sloshing effect caused by the movement of the cylindrical container. Achieving this objective can be accomplished by estab-lishing a mathematical model of sloshing, designing a reference trajectory, and implementing a trajectory tracking controller that incorporates the system's inherent uncertainties. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the closed-loop performance achieved by the nonlinear dynamic modeling and control method.
